# And


This file contains a simple `and` module written in verilog. Nothing really
challenging. Its only purpose is to act as a "hello world" program on FPGA's. It
also serves for testin installations of quartus of something really small that
does not take to much to build.


## Instructions


To build the project use:

`quartus_sh -t build.tcl`

For this to execute correctly, `quartus_sh` has to be on your path. This will
start all the compilation and synthesis process from the command line. If you
want to use the GUI just open the project file `and.qpf` and push the buttons as
you prefer.
